Modified and improved slitherio bot from [https://github.com/ermiyaeskandary/Slither.io-bot](https://github.com/ermiyaeskandary/Slither.io-bot) wrapped
in a self contained chrome extension.

## How to run

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start build process
4. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
5. Turn on developer mode
6. Select load unpacked and choose this folder
7. Go to [http://slither.io/](http://slither.io/)

From now on you just need to ensure the build process is running (if not, `npm start`). Refresh the slither.io page to see any changes you make.
